# data-fair/charts

A simple charting application for [DataFair](https://data-fair.github.io/2/). Also used as an [example for the documentation](https://data-fair.github.io/2/interoperate/applications).

It is hosted [by npm and the jsdelivr CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@data-fair/app-charts).

An example configuration can be found [here](https://koumoul.com/s/data-fair/application/data-fair-charts/config), it uses [this dataset](https://koumoul.com/s/data-fair/dataset/population-communes/description).

## Context

[DataFair](https://data-fair.github.io/2/) is an Open Source Web software developped by [Koumoul](https://koumoul.com) for publishing data online with complete search and aggregation capabilities, metadata management, mapping functionalities, access control, etc. It can be used as a back office for Open Data platforms, data visualizations , custom search engines and other applications.

DataFair comes with functionalities to facilitate the development, deployment and configuration of small data consuming applications. data-fair-charts is an example of such an application.

## Technical stack

This technical stack is just an example of what can be used to build an application for DataFair. It is a quite rich stack for a state of the art development environment. For an application with a more minimalist stack, you can see [app-minimal](https://github.com/data-fair/app-minimal). For a state of the art application generator see the [vue-cli plugin](https://github.com/data-fair/vue-cli-plugin-app).

  - [vuejs](https://vuejs.org/): our favorite framework for client-side code
  - [nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/guide): a higher level framework on top of vuejs for creating full applications (integrates [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and other tools)
  - [vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/): a material design UI framework for vuejs
  - [chartjs](https://www.chartjs.org/): simple charting library

## Development Setup

Start by downloading, cloning or forking this repository:

    git clone git@github.com:data-fair/app-charts.git
    cd app-charts

After a few seconds you can check that data-fair is up at [this url](http://localhost:8080). You can click on the links to log in with a new user, emails will be sent to a virtual mail server that you can access [here](http://localhost:1080/#/).

Create a dataset in your data-fair instance. You can use this [public dataset](https://koumoul.com/s/data-fair/dataset/population-communes/description) for example.

Install nodejs dependencies for the development environment:

    yarn

Run the development server and serve the application with hot reload [here](http://localhost:3000):

    npm run dev

You can now add an application configuration pointing to http://localhost:3000 in your data-fair instance. Edit the configuration, edit the code source, etc.

## DataFair application specificity

A DataFair application is mostly like any Web application. You can consume DataFair APIs from any framework for example. But for a seamless integration and multi-configuration management by DataFair you need to respect a few conventions. The following sections are a focus on the files that implement these conventions.

#### nuxt.config.js

The configuration file for the Nuxt framework. The important part for DataFair is the presence of the meta properties "title" and "description".

#### static/config-schema.json

A JSON schema file that describes the expected configuration. DataFair expects this file to be found at the precise path %MY APP%/config-schema.json.

The content of this JSON schema is extended with some annotations used by DataFair to automatically create a configuration form. The details of these annotations can be found in demo of the library we maintain to create these forms:  [vuetify-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/koumoul-dev/vuetify-jsonschema-form).

#### app.html

This the root template used to generate the HTML pages of this application. The key element here is this line:

    <script type="text/javascript">window.APPLICATION=%APPLICATION%;</script>

The string %APPLICATION% will be replaced automaticaly by the actual content of the configuration, when this application is re-exposed by DataFair. Later code can use the global variable APPLICATION to start interacting with the DataFair API.

## Deployment

Simply publish the project on the global npm registry (you need to be member of the owner organization).

    npm version PATCH|MINOR|MAJOR
    npm publish
    git push && git push --tags

If the release is a bug fix and you don't want to wait 24h (the cache delay of jsdelivr), you can purge the cache for the index.html file of the minor version in the CDN:

    curl https://purge.jsdelivr.net/npm/@data-fair/app-charts@0.8/dist/index.html

To publish a version for testing purposes you can tag it as a pre-release and publish it with the tag "staging".

    npm version prerelease --preid=staging
    npm publish --tag staging
    curl https://purge.jsdelivr.net/npm/@data-fair/app-charts@staging/dist/index.html
    git push && git push --tags
